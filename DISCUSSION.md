some stuff was skipped for brevity.

but overall this i got to a lot of the stuff i wanted to do.

pagination was put in the backend but the front end didn't get that support.

ideally we do cursor pagination but i just put in regular pages.

some styling was done to make things look cleaner. data tables are hard to display on mobile so we should consider what we want to do with this table for mobile users and how to best handle that.

overall got to clean up a lot of the app and structure it much better, theres definatly some work to be done and i do think server actions would help simplify things.

naturally things to expand on:

- cleaner typing
- cleaner more consistent styling
- pagination
- mobile first design
- debounce hook
- aria labels for the table
- more clear data viewing on the table.
